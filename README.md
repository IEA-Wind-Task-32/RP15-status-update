# Update to IEA Wind Recommended Practice 15
The 2013 IEA Wind Recommended Practices number 15, **"IEA Wind Recommended Practice 15 on Ground-Based Vertically-Profiling Remote Sensing For Wind Resource Assessment (2013)"** was developed by the wind lidar and sodar community in response to a clear need for a document that would establish repeatable good practice in measurements with active remote sensing devices (RSDs).

Since that document was pulbished in 2013, many things in the wind energy industry have changed. This repository contains the draft of an update by  IEA Wind Task 32 to that document.

This repository includes:
 - A PDF of the update: "main.pdf".
 - A banner image for use in the repository or elsewhere
 - All of the files required to produce the update using the LaTeX document preparation system.
 
<!-- note for maintainers: the repository has been set up to run latex on the main.tex file whenever a new commit is made -->
